### [1] [Hardware Implementation of Tunable Fractional-Order Capacitors by Morphogenesis of Conducting Polymer Dendrites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12861)

Abstract: Conventional electronics is founded on a paradigm where shaping perfect
electrical elements is done at the fabrication plant, so as to make devices and
systems identical, "eternally immutable". In nature, morphogenic evolutions are
observed in most living organisms and exploit topological plasticity as a
low-resource mechanism for in operando manufacturing and computation. Often
fractal, the resulting topologies feature inherent disorder: a property which
is never exploited in conventional electronics manufacturing, while necessary
for data generation and security in software. In this study, we present how
such properties can be exploited to implement long-term and evolvable synaptic
plasticity in an electronic hardware. The rich topology of conducting polymer
dendrites (CPDs) is exploited to program the non-ideality of their
electrochemical capacitances containing constant-phase-elements. Their
evolution through structural changes alters the characteristic time constants
for them to charge and discharge with the applied voltage stimuli. Under a
train of voltage spikes, the evolvable current relaxation of the
electrochemical systems promotes short-term plasticity with timescales ranging
from milliseconds to seconds. This large window depends on the temporality of
the voltage pulses used for reading, but also on the structure of a pair of
CPDs on two electrodes, grown by voltage pulses. This study demonstrates how
relevant physically transient and non-ideal electrochemical components can be
exploited for unconventional electronics, with the aim to mimic a universal
property of living organisms which could barely be replicated in a silicon
monocrystal.

### [2] [Extending the Mott-Gurney law to one-dimensional nonplanar diodes using point transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13138)
*Allen L. Garner,N. R. Sree Harsha,Amanda M. Loveless*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TLDR: 通过双射点变换将碰撞/半导体间隙中的Mott-Gurney定律推广至非平面一维几何结构，提出以规范间隙距离替代笛卡尔距离的修正公式，并建立多几何结构的通用表达体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法构建了多几何结构电流分析的统一框架，适用于从经典CL到MG定律之间的过渡区域，为半导体器件与等离子体装置设计提供普适性建模工具。

Abstract: Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and
point transformations to generalize the one-dimensional (1D) space-charge
limited current density (SCLCD) and electron emission mechanisms to nonplanar
geometries; however, these assessments have focused on extending the
Child-Langmuir law (CLL) for SCLCD in vacuum. Since the charge in the diode is
independent of coordinate system (i.e., covariant), we apply bijective point
transformations to extend the Mott-Gurney law (MGL) for the SCLCD in a
collisional or semiconductor gap to nonplanar 1D geometries. This yields a
modified MGL that replaces the Cartesian gap distance with a canonical gap
distance that may be written generally in terms of geometric scale factors that
are known for multiple geometries. We tabulate results for common geometries.
Such an approach may be applied to any current density, including
non-space-charge limited gaps and SCLCD that may fall between the CLL and MGL.

TLDR: 实现了基于单个²⁷Al⁺离子的光原子钟，频率不确定度达5.5×10⁻¹⁹，稳定性3.5×10⁻¹⁶/√τ，通过量子逻辑光谱和激光稳定性转移等技术显著提升性能。

Motivation: 解决传统铝离子钟稳定性不足的问题，通过改进激光稳定性、离子阱设计和磁场测量方法，提升原子钟的精确度和可靠性。

Method: 使用²⁵Mg⁺离子协同冷却与量子逻辑读出，通过3.6km光纤传输激光稳定性（实现1秒Rabi探测），改进离子阱电气设计降低微运动，优化真空系统减少碰撞偏移。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提高了铝离子钟的性能指标，为高精度时间计量和基础物理研究提供了更优解决方案，系统误差控制方法具有普适参考价值。

Abstract: We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency
uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5
\times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of
a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic
cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$
$^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s,
enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity
across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability
compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower
due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess
micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also
perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the
RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.

Conclusion: PySEMTools为复杂流体仿真提供标准化后处理方案，通过简化工作流程加速流体力学领域科研发现。

Abstract: PySEMTools is a Python-based library for post-processing simulation data
produced with high-order hexahedral elements in the context of the spectral
element method in computational fluid dynamics. It aims to minimize
intermediate steps typically needed when analyzing large files. Specifically,
the need to use separate codebases (like the solvers themselves) at
post-processing. For this effect, we leverage the use of message passing
interface (MPI) for distributed computing to perform typical data processing
tasks such as spectrally accurate differentiation, integration, interpolation,
and reduced order modeling, among others, on a spectral element mesh. All the
functionalities are provided in self-contained Python code and do not depend on
the use of a particular solver. We believe that `PySEMTools` provides tools to
researchers to accelerate scientific discovery and reduce the entry
requirements for the use of advanced methods in computational fluid dynamics.

### [5] [Laser flash analysis using the Cattaneo heat equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12590)
*Elliot J. Carr*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

Conclusion: 采用Cattaneo方程改进的模型能更准确地描述热传导的有限传播特性，为材料热物性测量提供了更精确的理论框架。

Abstract: Thermal diffusivity of solid materials is commonly measured using laser flash
analysis. This technique involves applying a heat pulse to the front surface of
a small sample of the material and calculating the thermal diffusivity from the
resulting increase in temperature on the back surface. Current formulas for the
thermal diffusivity are based on the assumption that heat is transported within
the sample according to the standard heat equation. While this assumption is
valid in most practical cases, it admits the non-physical property of infinite
propagation speed, that is, the heat pulse applied at the front surface is
instantaneously perceived at the back surface. This paper carries out a
mathematical analysis to determine the effect of replacing the standard heat
equation in laser flash analysis by the Cattaneo heat equation, which exhibits
finite propagation speed through the inclusion of a relaxation time in the
Fourier law. The main results of the paper include (i) analytical insights into
the spatiotemporal behaviour of temperature within the sample and (ii)
analytical formulas for determining the thermal diffusivity and relaxation time
of the sample. Numerical experiments exploring and verifying the analytical
results are presented with supporting MATLAB code made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该框架在可扩展性和准确性上超越现有方法，为铁电/热管理/超润滑纳米器件等应用提供通用解决方案

Abstract: Accurately modeling the structural reconstruction and thermodynamic behavior
of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures remains a significant challenge due to
the limitations of conventional force fields in capturing their complex
mechanical, thermal, electronic, and tribological properties. To address these
limitations, we develop a hybrid framework that combines single-layer
machine-learned potential ($s$MLP) with physics-based anisotropic interlayer
potential (ILP), effectively decoupling intralayer and interlayer interactions.
This $s$MLP+ILP approach modularizes the modeling of vdW heterostructures like
assembling LEGOs, reducing the required training configurations by at least an
order of magnitude compared to the pure MLP approach, while retaining
predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. We validate our framework by
accurately reproducing the mechanical properties of graphite, and resolving
intricate Moir\'e patterns in graphene/$h$-BN bilayers and
graphene/graphene/$h$-BN trilayer heterostructures, achieving excellent
agreement with experimental observations. Leveraging the developed $s$MLP+ILP
approach, we reveal the stacking order-dependent formation of Moir\'e
superlattice in trilayer graphene/$h$-BN/MoS$_2$ heterostructures,
demonstrating its ability to accurately model large-scale vdW systems
comprising hundreds of thousands of atoms with near $ab$ $initio$ precision.
These findings demonstrate that hybrid $s$MLP+ILP framework remarkably
outperforms existing pure machine-learned or empirical potentials, offering a
scalable and transferable solution for accurately and extensively modeling
complex vdW materials across diverse applications, including sliding
ferroelectricity, thermal management, resistive switching, and superlubric
nanodevices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粒子物理数据分析常需用控制样本估计目标样本的多维概率密度，传统方法难以保持变量间相关性。研究旨在通过生成式机器学习解决蒙特卡罗模拟与真实数据的分布匹配问题。

Method: 采用条件归一化流模型(CNF)，通过链式双射器转换未配对的模拟事件为数据事件，结合MDMM方法优化收敛性并为损失函数参数赋予物理意义。

Conclusion: CNF模型为多维PDF估计提供有效解决方案，MDMM的应用突破传统优化限制，为高能物理数据分析开辟新路径。

Abstract: We explore a generative machine learning-based approach for estimating
multi-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) in a target sample using
a statistically independent but related control sample - a common challenge in
particle physics data analysis. The generative model must accurately reproduce
individual observable distributions while preserving the correlations between
them, based on the input multidimensional distribution from the control sample.
Here we present a conditional normalizing flow model (CNF) based on a chain of
bijectors which learns to transform unpaired simulation events to data events.
We assess the performance of the CNF model in the context of LHC Higgs to
diphoton analysis, where we use the CNF model to convert a Monte Carlo diphoton
sample to one that models data. We show that the CNF model can accurately model
complex data distributions and correlations. We also leverage the recently
popularized Modified Differential Multiplier Method (MDMM) to improve the
convergence of our model and assign physical meaning to usually arbitrary
loss-function parameters.

### [8] [Maximum Information Extraction From Noisy Data Via Shannon Entropy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12990)

Main category: physics.data-an

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以在噪声数据分析中实现最大信息提取，特别是在处理高维数据时可能存在无效噪声干扰

Method: 使用香农熵作为可转移度量标准，通过分子动力学模拟的固/液相变水-冰体系时间序列数据，分析数据分布和时间序列相关性

Conclusion: 该方法为数据分析和系统研究提供了无需参数的通用框架及量化指标，特别适用于处理复杂系统中的高维数据集

Abstract: Granting maximum information extraction in the analysis of noisy data is
non-trivial. We introduce a general, data-driven approach that employs Shannon
entropy as a transferable metric to quantify the maximum information
extractable from noisy data via their clustering into statistically-relevant
micro-domains. We demonstrate the method's efficiency by analyzing, as a
representative example, time-series data extracted from molecular dynamics
simulations of water and ice coexisting at the solid/liquid transition
temperature. The method allows quantifying the information contained in the
data distributions (time-independent component) and the additional information
gain attainable by analyzing data as time-series (i.e., accounting for the
information contained in data time-correlations). The approach is also highly
effective for high-dimensional datasets, providing clear demonstrations of how
considering components/data that may be little informative but noisy may be not
only useless but even detrimental to maximum information extraction. This
provides a general and robust parameter-free approach and quantitative metrics
for data-analysis, and for the study of any type of system from its data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统t*计算方法依赖射线追踪，计算成本高且在复杂介质中易失效，需开发更高效可靠的新方法。

Method: 分两步：1) 快速扫描法求解程函方程获取走时场；2) MFSM基于走时梯度的上风离散化求解t*控制方程，开发了笛卡尔/球坐标两个版本。

Result: 通过解析解对比和网格细化误差验证MFSM精度，北岛实例验证实用性，展示了地震响应谱估计的高效性。

Conclusion: MFSM规避显式射线追踪，显著提升计算效率，适用于复杂介质中的地震衰减层析成像和响应谱分析。

Abstract: $t^*$ represents the total path attenuation and characterizes the amplitude
decay of a propagating seismic wave. Calculating the attenuation operator $t^*$
is typically required in seismic attenuation tomography. Traditional methods
for calculating $t^*$ require determining the ray path explicitly. However, ray
tracing can be computationally intensive when processing large datasets, and
conventional ray tracing techniques may fail even in mildly heterogeneous
media. In this study, we propose a modified fast sweeping method (MFSM) to
solve the governing equation for $t^*$ without explicitly calculating the ray
path. The approach consists of two main steps. First, the traveltime field is
calculated by numerically solving the eikonal equation using the fast sweeping
method. Second, $t^*$ is computed by solving its governing equation with the
MFSM, based on the discretization of the gradient of $t^*$ using an upwinding
scheme derived from the traveltime gradient. The MFSM is rigorously validated
through comparisons with analytical solutions and by examining $t^*$ errors
under grid refinement in both simple and complex models. Key performance
metrics, including convergence, number of iterations, and computation time, are
evaluated. Two versions of the MFSM are developed for both Cartesian and
spherical coordinate systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the
developed MFSM in calculating $t^*$ in North Island, and discuss the method's
efficiency in estimating earthquake response spectra.

Conclusion: BNSL技术为量子模拟、原子干涉测量提供了新工具，在精密测量和量子计算领域具有重要应用前景

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of Beat-Note Superlattices (BNSLs), a
recently demonstrated technique for generating periodic trapping potentials for
ultracold atomic clouds, with arbitrarily large lattice spacings while
maintaining interferometric stability. By combining two optical lattices with
slightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed,
generating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity
equal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wavevectors of
the two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under
which this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against
perturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer
significant advantages in comparison to well established techniques for the
manipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of
BNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in
quantum technologies.

Abstract: Disordered potentials fundamentally alter the transport properties and
coherence of quantum systems. They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson
localization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When
interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly
more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed
remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is
expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state
without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a
ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite
temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced
phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold
bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the
Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved,
reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ
distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the
Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the
Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with
single-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of
the Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.

Motivation: 解决GNN模型对域外数据预测不可靠且难识别的问题，需开发轻量级不确定性量化方法提升模型可信度

Result: DPOSE成功区分域内外样本，对未观测分子/材料类表现出更高不确定性，验证其有效性

Conclusion: 轻量级UQ方法显著增强GNN可靠性，为后续与主动学习的结合奠定基础

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by
providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material
properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art
approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However,
GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data
and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge,
we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct
Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient
alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we
assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse
Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular
Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes
between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for
unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of
lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials
modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning
strategies.

Abstract: The single-band high-efficiency light absorption of nanostructures finds
extensive applications in var ious fields such as photothermal conversion,
optical sensing, and biomedicine. In this paper, a vertically stacked
nanohybrid structure is designed with aluminum arsenide (AlAs), indium tin ox
ide (ITO) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) stacked, and the photon absorption
characteristics of this structure under near-infrared light at a single
wavelength of 1240 nm are exploredbased on the finite difference time domain
(FDTD) method. When AlAs, ITO, and GaAs are stacked and incident light enters
from the GaAs side, a local light enhancement phenomenon occurs. The absorption
rate can reach 91.67%, and the temperature change rate reaches 55. 53%,
allowing for a wide-range regulation the absorption rate by temperature. In
addition, the AlAs/ITO/GaAs sandwich-type hybrid structure also exhibits
obvious nonreciprocity. With the change in temperature, the absorption rate of
different structural sizes varies differently. The structure can be optimized
and designed according to the requirements, providing new ideas for the design
of multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) are widely used photonic components for
splitting and combining different wavelengths of light. They play a key role in
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems by enabling efficient routing of
multiple data channels over a single optical fiber and as a building block for
various optical signal processing, computing, imaging, and spectroscopic
applications. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating AWGs in
ferroelectric material platforms, as the platform simultaneously provide
efficient electro-optic modulation capability and thus hold the promise for
fully integrated WDM transmitters. To date, several demonstrations have been
made in the X-cut thin-film lithium niobate ($\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$) platform, yet,
the large anisotropy of $\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ complicates the design and degrades
the performance of the AWGs. To address this limitation, we use the recently
developed photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on thin-film lithium
tantalate ($\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$), a material with a similar Pockels coefficient
as $\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ but significantly reduced optical anisotropy, as an
alternative viable platform. In this work, we manufacture $\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$
AWGs using deep ultraviolet lithography on a wafer-scale. The fabricated AWGs
feature a channel spacing of 100 GHz, an insertion loss of < 4 dB and crosstalk
of < -14 dB. In addition, we demonstrate a cyclic AWG, as well as a
multiplexing and demultiplexing AWG pair for the first time on
$\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ platform. The wafer-scale fabrication of these AWGs not only
ensures uniformity and reproducibility, but also paves the way for realizing
volume-manufactured integrated WDM transmitters in ferroelectric photonic
integrated platforms.

Conclusion: 该研究推动非热烧蚀机理理解，为优化超快激光加工提供工具支持

Abstract: Much experimental evidence reveals that Coulomb explosion governs non-thermal
material removal under femtosecond or even shorter laser pulses, and
non-thermal laser damage has been a topic widely discussed. Nevertheless, there
is still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of
such damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage
through a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter
of the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion,
electron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates
material from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in
localized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability
and demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser
conditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and
provides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing.

Abstract: Parametric arrays (PA) offer exceptional directivity and compactness compared
to conventional loudspeakers, facilitating various acoustic applications.
However, accurate measurement of audio signals generated by PA remains
challenging due to spurious ultrasonic sounds arising from microphone
nonlinearities. Existing filtering methods, including Helmholtz resonators,
phononic crystals, polymer films, and grazing incidence techniques, exhibit
practical constraints such as size limitations, fabrication complexity, or
insufficient attenuation. To address these issues, we propose and demonstrate a
novel acoustic filter based on the design of a half-wavelength resonator. The
developed filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution,
effectively minimizing microphone exposure to targeted ultrasonic frequencies.
Fabrication via stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing ensures high dimensional
accuracy, which is crucial for high-frequency acoustic filters. Finite element
method (FEM) simulations guided filter optimization for suppression frequencies
at 40 kHz and 60 kHz, achieving high transmission loss (TL) around 60 dB.
Experimental validations confirm the filter's superior performance in
significantly reducing spurious acoustic signals, as reflected in frequency
response, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements. The proposed filter
ensures stable and precise acoustic characterization, independent of
measurement distances and incidence angles. This new approach not only improves
measurement accuracy but also enhances reliability and reproducibility in
parametric array research and development.

Abstract: Multigap cavities are used extensively in linear accelerators to achieve
velocities up to a few percent of the speed of light, driving nuclear physics
research around the world. Unlike for single-gap structures, there is no
closed-form expression to calculate the output beam parameters from the cavity
voltage and phase. To overcome this, we propose to use a method based on the
integration of the first and second moments of the beam distribution through
the axially symmetric time-dependent fields of the cavity. A beam-based
calibration between the model's electric field scaling and the machine's rf
amplitudes is presented, yielding a fast online energy change method, returning
cavity amplitude and phase necessary for a desired output beam energy and
energy spread. The method is validated with 23Na6+ beam energy measurements.

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement and reset of subsets of qubits is a crucial
ingredient of quantum error correction and many quantum information
applications. Measurement of atomic qubits is accomplished through resonant
fluorescence, which typically disturbs neighboring atoms due to photon
scattering. We propose and prototype a new scheme for measurement that provides
both spatial and spectral isolation by using tightly-focused individual laser
beams and narrow atomic transitions. The unique advantage of this scheme is
that all operations are applied exclusively to the read-out qubit, with
negligible disturbance to the other qubits of the same species and little
overhead. In this letter, we pave the way for non-invasive and high fidelity
mid-circuit measurement and demonstrate all key building blocks on a single
trapped barium ion.

Conclusion: 该方案在单种类离子链中实现MCMR操作，无需离子穿梭或额外寻址光学元件，显著简化量子计算机架构设计

Abstract: We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a
trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in
$^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating
data qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the
metastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable
state without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both
methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$
ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit.
These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without
degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser
noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated
method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without
shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the
architecture.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations are crucial in industrial
applications but require extensive computational resources, particularly for
extreme turbulent regimes. While classical digital approaches remain the
standard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more
efficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits.
  This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid
quantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).
The inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion
and solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate
this method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions,
periodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on
high-performance computing resources.
  Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error
fidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for
practical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small
lattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway
to mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation.
