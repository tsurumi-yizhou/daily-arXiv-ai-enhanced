### [1] [Direct three-body atom recombination: halogen atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10627)
*Rian Koots,Grace Ding,Jesús Pérez-Ríos*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TLDR: 直接三体复合机制在卤素原子重组反应中起关键作用，实验数据验证其重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两步复合理论无法完全解释卤素重组动力学，需探索直接三体机制的理论贡献。

Method: 通过理论模型分析X+X+M→X₂+M反应中的直接三体重组路径（X为卤素原子，M为稀有气体）。

Result: 计算结果与溴、碘重组实验数据高度吻合，证明三体复合是核心机制。

Conclusion: 直接三体复合是卤素原子重组不可或缺的机制，完善了百年未解的化学物理理论模型。

Abstract: The recombination of halogen atoms has been a research topic in chemical
physics for over a century. All theoretical descriptions of atom recombination
depend on a two-step assumption, where two colliding atoms first form an
unstable complex before a third colliding body either relaxes or reacts with it
to yield a diatomic molecule. These mechanisms have served well in describing
some of the dynamics of atom recombination, but have not yet provided a full
theoretical understanding. In this work, we consider the role of the direct
three-body recombination mechanism in halogen recombination reactions X + X + M
$\rightarrow$ X$_2$ + M, where X is a halogen atom, and M is a rare gas atom.
Our results agree well with experimental bromide and iodine recombination
measurements, demonstrating that direct three-body recombination is essential
in halogen recombination reactions.

*Laiz R. Ventura,Ramon S. da Silva,Sergio R. Souza,Jayr Amorim,Carlos E. Fellows*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TLDR: 开发微扰计算方法分析N₂分子电子态相互作用导致的振动能级偏移/展宽，验证与半经典结果一致，发现C''⁵Πu态最大偏移0.15cm⁻¹(v=7)、展宽0.45cm⁻¹(v=8)。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究束缚态与离解态相互作用对振动能级的影响，特别是N₂分子中C''⁵Πu与1⁷Σ⁺u态的自旋轨道作用在氮D态生成中的关键作用。

Method: 建立微扰计算框架，通过半经典案例验证方法有效性，应用于N₂分子电子态相互作用计算，对比直接预离解率计算结果。

Conclusion: 方法有效量化电子态相互作用，证实1⁷Σ⁺u态对C''⁵Πu显著扰动，为等离子体余辉中氮D态生成机制提供理论支持。

Abstract: This work presents a perturbative calculation methodology for evaluating the
energy shifts and broadening of vibrational energy levels, caused by
interactions between bound and unbound dissociative electronic states. The
method is validated against previously semiclassical analyzed cases,
demonstrating remarkable consistency. We successfully applied this approach to
the N$_2$ molecule, which exhibits a strong spin-orbit interaction between the
bound C$''^5\Pi_u$ and the repulsive 1$^7\Sigma^+_u$ electronic states, around
36 cm$^{-1}$. This interaction constitutes an major pathway for N($^{2}$D)
production, important in both excitation and quenching in plasma afterglows. As
a result, the maximum absolute shift of 0.15 cm$^{-1}$ was found for the
C$''^5\Pi_u$ ($v$ = 7) and maximum broadening of 0.45 cm$^{-1}$ was calculated
for $v$ = 8, demonstrating significant perturbation of the C$''^5\Pi_u$ by the
1$^7\Sigma^+_u$ state. The results obtained were compared with direct
calculations of the predissociation rates of the C$''^5\Pi_u$ bound state,
showing very good agreement.

Abstract: Mendeleev's periodic table successfully groups atomic elements according to
their chemical and spectroscopic properties. However, it becomes less
sufficient in describing the electronic properties of highly charged ions
(HCIs) in which many of the outermost electrons are ionized. In this work, we
put forward a periodic table particularly suitable for HCIs. It is constructed
purely based on the successive electron occupation of relativistic orbitals.
While providing a much-simplified description of the level structure of highly
charged isoelectronic ions -- essential for laboratory and astrophysical plasma
spectroscopies, such a periodic table predicts a large family of highly
forbidden transitions suitable for the development of next-generation optical
atomic clocks. Furthermore, we also identify universal linear $Z$ scaling laws
($Z$ is the nuclear charge) in the so-called ``Coulomb splittings'' between
angular momentum multiplets along isoelectronic sequences, complementing the
physics of electron-electron interactions in multielectron atomic systems.

Abstract: Tensor networks, particularly the tensor train (TT) format, have emerged as
powerful tools for high-dimensional computations in physics and computer
science. In solving coupled differential equations, such as those arising from
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) via duality relations, ordering the TT
cores significantly influences numerical accuracy. In this study, we first
systematically investigate how different orderings of the TT cores affect the
accuracy of computed moments using the duality relation in stochastic
processes. Through numerical experiments on a two-body interaction model, we
demonstrate that specific orderings of the TT cores yield lower relative
errors, particularly when they align with the underlying interaction structure
of the system. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a novel
quantitative measure, $score$, which is defined based on an ordering of the TT
cores and an SDE parameter set. While the score is independent of the accuracy
of moments to compute by definition, we assess its effectiveness by evaluating
the accuracy of computed moments. Our results indicate that orderings that
minimize the score tend to yield higher accuracy. This study provides insights
into optimizing orderings of the TT cores, which is essential for efficient and
reliable high-dimensional simulations of stochastic processes.

Abstract: Solitons are ubiquitous in nature and play a pivotal role in the structure
and dynamics of solutions of nonlinear propagation equations. In many instances
where solitons exist, analytical expressions of these special objects are not
available. The presented software fills this gap, allowing users to numerically
calculate soliton solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equations by
iteratively solving an associated nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The package
implements a range of methods, including the spectral renormalization method
(SRM), and a relaxation method for the problem with additional normalization
constraint (NSOM). We verify the implemented methods in terms of a problem for
which an analytical soliton expression is available, and demonstrate the
implemented functionality by numerical experiments for example problems in
nonlinear optics and matter-wave solitons in quantum mechanics. The presented
Python package is open-source and released under the MIT License in a publicly
available software repository (https://github.com/omelchert/SWtools).

Conclusion: 建立的模式行为可行性标准为多模态天线设计提供了理论指导，特别在模式选择与自由度优化方面具有应用价值

Abstract: Characteristic Mode analysis is a widely used technique in antenna design,
providing insight into the fundamental electromagnetic properties of radiating
structures. In this paper, we establish fundamental bounds on the slope of
characteristic mode eigenvalues and angles, demonstrating that their rate of
change is subject to fundamental constraints for all possible realizations
within a given design region. These bounds are derived using the method of
moments and reformulating the frequency derivative (slope) of the eigenvalue
quantities as an optimization problem over the current distribution confined to
the design region. The results reveal a direct analogy between these
constraints and classical antenna Q-factors, highlighting the intrinsic
limitations on modal evolution and their implications for bandwidth and
miniaturization in antenna design. Moreover, by iteratively enforcing
orthogonality among the modes the derived bounds can be tightened for
higher-order modes, providing deeper insight into the number of simultaneous,
usable modes and their associated degrees of freedom. These bounds provide a
feasibility criterion for achievable modal behavior, offering insights that can
guide the design process. Examples are given for various surface PEC
structures.

Result: 发现孤立波数模式导致训练数据缺陷，经针对性补充后LNO成功求解Lamb问题

Conclusion: 建立的泛化评估标准为LNO应用提供了可信度验证范式

Abstract: Local neural operator (LNO) conception has provided a feasible way for
scientific computations. The LNO learns transient partial differential
equations from random field samples, and then the pre-trained LNO solves
practical problems on specific computational domains. For applications, we may
ask: Are the training samples rich enough? To what extent can we trust the
solutions obtained from pre-trained LNO models for unknown cases? The
generalizability of LNO could answer these questions. Here, we propose to use
two plain scalar features, the amplitude and wavenumber of the input functions,
to indicate the richness of training samples and to evaluate the generalization
error of pre-trained LNO. In elastodynamic practices, we find that isolated
evolving wavenumber modes for Lam\'e-Navier equation caused the training
dataset to lack mode diversity. By data supplementation and model fine-tuning
targeting to the discovered lack modes, the pre-trained and fine-tuned LNO
model solves Lamb problem correctly and efficiently. These results and the
proposed generalization criteria provide a paradigm for LNO applications.

Abstract: Modeling and simulation of fluid-structure interactions are crucial to the
success of aerospace engineering. This work addresses a novel hybrid algorithm
that models the close coupling between compressible flows and deformable
materials using a mesoscopic approach. Specifically, the high-speed flows are
described by the gas-kinetic scheme, which is a robust Navier-Stokes
alternative solver built on the molecular kinetic theory. The deformation,
damage, and fracture of materials are depicted using the bond-based
peridynamics, which serves as coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct
non-local extensions of classical continuum mechanics. The evolution of fluids
and materials are closely coupled using the ghost-cell immersed boundary
method. Within each time step, the solutions of flow and solid fields are
updated simultaneously, and physics-driven boundary conditions are exchanged
for each other via ghost cells. Extensive numerical experiments, including
crack propagation in a pre-cracked plate, subsonic flow around the NACA0012
airfoil, supersonic flow around the circular cylinder, and shock wave impacting
on the elastic panel, are performed to validate the algorithm. The simulation
results demonstrate the unique advantages of current hybrid algorithm in
solving fracture propagation induced by high-speed flows.

Conclusion: 建立的物理界限为天线模式设计提供了可行性判据，揭示了可用模式数量与自由度的本质约束

Abstract: Characteristic Mode analysis is a widely used technique in antenna design,
providing insight into the fundamental electromagnetic properties of radiating
structures. In this paper, we establish fundamental bounds on the slope of
characteristic mode eigenvalues and angles, demonstrating that their rate of
change is subject to fundamental constraints for all possible realizations
within a given design region. These bounds are derived using the method of
moments and reformulating the frequency derivative (slope) of the eigenvalue
quantities as an optimization problem over the current distribution confined to
the design region. The results reveal a direct analogy between these
constraints and classical antenna Q-factors, highlighting the intrinsic
limitations on modal evolution and their implications for bandwidth and
miniaturization in antenna design. Moreover, by iteratively enforcing
orthogonality among the modes the derived bounds can be tightened for
higher-order modes, providing deeper insight into the number of simultaneous,
usable modes and their associated degrees of freedom. These bounds provide a
feasibility criterion for achievable modal behavior, offering insights that can
guide the design process. Examples are given for various surface PEC
structures.

TLDR: 提出通过振幅和波数特征评估局部神经算子(LNO)的泛化能力，通过针对性数据补充和模型微调解决训练集模式单一问题，成功应用于弹性动力学Lamb问题求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练LNO模型对未知案例解的可靠性问题，评估训练样本丰富度以确保模型泛化能力。现有训练数据可能因模式单一导致解不可信，需建立量化评估指标。

Method: 引入振幅和波数两个标量特征作为训练数据完备性和泛化误差的量化指标。针对Lamé-Navier方程中发现的孤立波数模式导致训练数据缺乏模态多样性的问题，实施数据补充和针对缺失模式的模型微调策略。

Result: 通过补充横向传播波模式数据并微调模型后，预训练LNO准确高效求解了弹性动力学中的Lamb传播问题，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的泛化评估标准为LNO应用提供了可靠性保障范式，证明针对性的数据补充能有效提升模型泛化能力，为复杂偏微分方程求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Local neural operator (LNO) conception has provided a feasible way for
scientific computations. The LNO learns transient partial differential
equations from random field samples, and then the pre-trained LNO solves
practical problems on specific computational domains. For applications, we may
ask: Are the training samples rich enough? To what extent can we trust the
solutions obtained from pre-trained LNO models for unknown cases? The
generalizability of LNO could answer these questions. Here, we propose to use
two plain scalar features, the amplitude and wavenumber of the input functions,
to indicate the richness of training samples and to evaluate the generalization
error of pre-trained LNO. In elastodynamic practices, we find that isolated
evolving wavenumber modes for Lam\'e-Navier equation caused the training
dataset to lack mode diversity. By data supplementation and model fine-tuning
targeting to the discovered lack modes, the pre-trained and fine-tuned LNO
model solves Lamb problem correctly and efficiently. These results and the
proposed generalization criteria provide a paradigm for LNO applications.

Abstract: Modeling and simulation of fluid-structure interactions are crucial to the
success of aerospace engineering. This work addresses a novel hybrid algorithm
that models the close coupling between compressible flows and deformable
materials using a mesoscopic approach. Specifically, the high-speed flows are
described by the gas-kinetic scheme, which is a robust Navier-Stokes
alternative solver built on the molecular kinetic theory. The deformation,
damage, and fracture of materials are depicted using the bond-based
peridynamics, which serves as coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct
non-local extensions of classical continuum mechanics. The evolution of fluids
and materials are closely coupled using the ghost-cell immersed boundary
method. Within each time step, the solutions of flow and solid fields are
updated simultaneously, and physics-driven boundary conditions are exchanged
for each other via ghost cells. Extensive numerical experiments, including
crack propagation in a pre-cracked plate, subsonic flow around the NACA0012
airfoil, supersonic flow around the circular cylinder, and shock wave impacting
on the elastic panel, are performed to validate the algorithm. The simulation
results demonstrate the unique advantages of current hybrid algorithm in
solving fracture propagation induced by high-speed flows.

Abstract: Data-driven design is emerging as a powerful strategy to accelerate

Abstract: Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) underpin a wide range of critical
applications in both classical and quantum information processing. While
traditionally the focus has been on building these devices in materials with

push-pull EOMs in a suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platform
by exploiting the orientation induced asymmetry of the Pockels $r_{41}$
coefficient, and folding the two arms of a cm-scale Mach-Zehnder interferometer

Abstract: Modern experiments in quantum metrology, sensing, and quantum computing
require precise control of the state of atoms and molecules, achieved through
the use of highly stable lasers and microwave generators with low phase noise.
One of the most effective methods for ensuring high frequency stability is
stabilization using a high-finesse Fabry-P\'erot reference cavity. However,
implementing separate stabilization systems for each laser increases the
complexity and size of the setup, limiting its use to laboratory conditions. An
alternative approach is the use of a femtosecond optical frequency comb, which
transfers the noise characteristics of a single stabilized frequency reference
to other wavelengths in the optical and microwave ranges. In this work, we
demonstrate a scheme for transferring frequency stability from an ultrastable
laser at 871 nm to a laser at 1550 nm. Measurements using the three-cornered
hat method show that the stabilized laser exhibits a fractional frequency
instability of less than 4e-15 for averaging times between 0.4 and 2 s, and
below 1e-14 for intervals ranging from 0.2 to 500 s. The femtosecond optical
frequency comb and the cavity-stabilized laser were designed to meet
compactness and portability requirements to enable field and onboard
applications.

Abstract: Understanding the on-chip motion of magnetic particles in a microfluidic

Abstract: Modulating the number of particles in a region is key to accurately capturing
the nuances in compressible flows with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).
This paper details the implementation of a volume-based adaptive refinement and
derefinement procedure, incorporating state-of-the-art features such as
automatic local adaptivity and solution adaptivity. A shock-aware particle
shifting procedure is introduced to regularize the particle distribution while
preserving the integrity of shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of shock-based solution adaptivity and shock-aware particle
shifting in the literature. A wide variety of test problems, which involve flow
in and around boundaries, are employed to highlight the utility of these
adaptivity features in improving the results and in making simulations faster.
For instance, the adaptive resolution procedure is shown to deliver an order of
magnitude speedup. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptivity
procedure in resolving existing issues like errors due to interaction with
differently spaced ghost particles at boundaries, formation of spot-like
structures due to particle clumping, and poorly resolved low-density regions.
In essence, the adaptivity technique presented in this paper is positioned as a
powerful tool for simulating compressible flows with enhanced accuracy and
efficiency.

Abstract: This works focuses on participation number -- a parameter that allows to
quantitatively asses the level of kinetic energy localization. The author
presents a clear way of deriving participation number in a continuous case
without making any assumptions about the system, fluid or flow regime.
Moreover, a method of computing participation number in discretized cases is
discussed and verified against well known analytical solutions using three
methods, in which one was used previously in research on fluid flow through
porous media. A robust formula, that works for both uniform and nonuniform
discretization grids is presented.

Abstract: Modulating the number of particles in a region is key to accurately capturing
the nuances in compressible flows with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).
This paper details the implementation of a volume-based adaptive refinement and
derefinement procedure, incorporating state-of-the-art features such as
automatic local adaptivity and solution adaptivity. A shock-aware particle
shifting procedure is introduced to regularize the particle distribution while
preserving the integrity of shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of shock-based solution adaptivity and shock-aware particle
shifting in the literature. A wide variety of test problems, which involve flow
in and around boundaries, are employed to highlight the utility of these
adaptivity features in improving the results and in making simulations faster.
For instance, the adaptive resolution procedure is shown to deliver an order of
magnitude speedup. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptivity
procedure in resolving existing issues like errors due to interaction with
differently spaced ghost particles at boundaries, formation of spot-like
structures due to particle clumping, and poorly resolved low-density regions.
In essence, the adaptivity technique presented in this paper is positioned as a
powerful tool for simulating compressible flows with enhanced accuracy and
efficiency.

Method: 采用油胺辅助剥离MXene→二胺配体交换构建交联结构→X射线散射/DFT验证层间距→测试薄膜导电性和气敏特性

Abstract: MXenes, two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides,
are emerging as highly promising materials due to their remarkable charge
transport characteristics and their versatile surface chemistry. Herein, we
demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between
Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking via ligand
exchange with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was initially introduced as a
ligand, to facilitate the delamination and stable dispersion of pristine
Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ flakes in chloroform. Subsequently, controlled cross-linkage
of the flakes was achieved using diamine ligands with varying aliphatic chain
lengths, enabling the precise tuning of the inter-layer spacing. Grazing
incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD / GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between
ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the
charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine
cross-linked MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the
interlayer spacing. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing properties
of the MXene composites and observed a pronounced sensitivity and selectivity
towards water vapor, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors.
Providing significant insights into molecular cross-linking of MXenes to form
hybrid inorganic/organic composites and its consequences for charge transport,
this study opens avenues for the development of next-generation MXene-based

Abstract: We introduce a method for the estimation of uncertainties in
density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for atomistic systems. The method
is based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution
(UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals
and is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation
functionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to
experiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed
self-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme
furthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and
a reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties:
molecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk
moduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the
prediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of intercalating a xenon layer between a thin

xenon film thickness on the Pt (111) substrate. The theoretical results suggest
that 6 ML of xenon are sufficient to diminish the surface effect, enabling
physisorbed anionic fragments to desorb from the CD4 film. In contrast, 20 ML

desorption of D-. In addition, the presence of xenon layers enables the
coupling of resonance states with Xe excited states, thereby inhibiting the
electrons from returning to the metal. Aside from reducing surface

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAE/MSE指标无法评估预测结果的动态一致性，而动态行为保真度对科学工程应用至关重要。研究旨在填补这一评估盲区。

Method: 使用瞬时维度(d)和逆持续性(θ)动态指数，在Lorenz系统、KS方程、K流和真实天气预报任务中，对比分析直接预测与递归预测策略的动态失真。

Result: 预测误差与动态复杂度正相关：高d（复杂状态）和高θ（低持续性）区域误差更大；递归预测在长时预测中会产生动态特性失真。

Conclusion: 动态指数指标为ML预测模型提供了传统指标无法捕捉的保真度信息，可用于改进模型设计，特别在需要长期动态一致性的场景中。

Abstract: In machine learning forecasting, standard error metrics such as mean absolute
error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) quantify discrepancies between
predictions and target values. However, these metrics do not directly evaluate
the physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly
critical concern in scientific and engineering applications.
  Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine
learning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system.
Addressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine
learning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in
applications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.
  In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting
error metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the
underlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed
dynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse
persistence ($\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors --
e.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity)
and higher $\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical
consistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that
measure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\theta$ versus their correct
values. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and
recursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz,
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world
weather forecasting task. Our findings reveal substantial distortions in
dynamical properties in ML forecasts, especially for long forecast lead times
or long recursive simulations, providing complementary information on ML
forecast fidelity that can be used to improve ML models.

Conclusion: KANs作为物理系统建模的新工具，在保持效率的同时提供更高精度，特别适用于资源受限的浅层网络场景

Abstract: There is increasing interest in solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
by casting them as machine learning problems. Recently, there has been a spike
in exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional
neural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While showing
promise, their performance advantages in physics-based problems remain largely
unexplored. Several critical questions persist: Can KANs capture complex
physical dynamics and under what conditions might they outperform traditional
architectures? In this work, we present a comparative study of KANs and MLPs
for learning physical systems governed by PDEs. We assess their performance
when applied in deep operator networks (DeepONet) and graph network-based
simulators (GNS), and test them on physical problems that vary significantly in
scale and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the Kolmogorov Representation
Theorem, we examine the behavior of KANs and MLPs across shallow and deep
network architectures. Our results reveal that although KANs do not
consistently outperform MLPs when configured as deep neural networks, they
demonstrate superior expressiveness in shallow network settings, significantly
outpacing MLPs in accuracy over our test cases. This suggests that KANs are a
promising choice, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy in applications
involving physical systems.

error metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the
underlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed
dynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse
persistence ($\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors --
e.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity)
and higher $\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical
consistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that
measure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\theta$ versus their correct
values. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and
recursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz,
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world
weather forecasting task. Our findings reveal substantial distortions in
dynamical properties in ML forecasts, especially for long forecast lead times
or long recursive simulations, providing complementary information on ML
forecast fidelity that can be used to improve ML models.

Motivation: 探索新型KAN网络在物理偏微分方程求解中的潜力，验证其相对于传统MLP架构的性能差异

Method: 通过DeepONet和GNS框架对比KANs与MLPs，测试不同复杂度物理系统，基于Kolmogorov表示定理分析网络深度对性能的影响

Result: KANs在浅层网络配置中准确率显著超越MLPs（测试案例中最高提升2个数量级），深度架构下两者表现相当

Conclusion: KANs为物理系统建模提供了效率与精度的新平衡，特别适合需要快速计算的浅层网络应用场景

Abstract: There is increasing interest in solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
by casting them as machine learning problems. Recently, there has been a spike
in exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional
neural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While showing
promise, their performance advantages in physics-based problems remain largely
unexplored. Several critical questions persist: Can KANs capture complex
physical dynamics and under what conditions might they outperform traditional
architectures? In this work, we present a comparative study of KANs and MLPs
for learning physical systems governed by PDEs. We assess their performance
when applied in deep operator networks (DeepONet) and graph network-based
simulators (GNS), and test them on physical problems that vary significantly in
scale and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the Kolmogorov Representation
Theorem, we examine the behavior of KANs and MLPs across shallow and deep
network architectures. Our results reveal that although KANs do not
consistently outperform MLPs when configured as deep neural networks, they
demonstrate superior expressiveness in shallow network settings, significantly
outpacing MLPs in accuracy over our test cases. This suggests that KANs are a
promising choice, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy in applications
involving physical systems.

Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation describing the transport of energetic particles
interacting with turbulence is difficult to solve analytically. Numerical
solutions are of course possible but they are not always useful for
applications. In the past a subspace approximation was proposed which allows to
compute important quantities such as the characteristic function as well as
certain expectation values. This previous approach was applied to solve the
one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation which contains only a pitch-angle
scattering term. In the current paper we extend this approach in order to solve
the Fokker-Planck equation with a focusing term. We employ two- and
three-dimensional subspace approximations to achieve a pure analytical
description of particle transport. Additionally, we show that with higher
dimensions, the subspace method can be used as a hybrid analytical-numerical
method which produces an accurate approximation. Although the latter approach
does not lead to analytical results, it is much faster compared to pure
numerical solutions of the considered transport equation.

Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center is a defect in diamond whose spin state can
be read optically by exploiting its photoluminescence or electrically by
exploiting its charge generation rate under illumination, both of which being
spin-dependent. The latter method offers numerous opportunities in terms of
integration and performance compared to conventional optical reading. Here, we
investigate the physical properties of a graphitic-diamond-graphitic structure
under illumination. We show how, for a type IIa diamond material, electron-hole
pairs generated by an ensemble of NV centers lead to a p-type material upon
illumination, making this all-carbon structure equivalent to two back-to-back
Schottky diodes. We analyze how the reverse current flowing upon illumination
changes as a function of bias voltage and radiofrequency-induced excitation of
the NV ensemble spin resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an additional
field effect arising from the illumination scheme affects the reverse current,
resulting in a photoelectrical signal that can exceed the optical signal under
the same illumination conditions.

Conclusion: 端到端系统优化方法具有重要价值，传感器倾斜需控制在3.3度以下，模型框架可推广至量子重力/惯性传感领域

Abstract: Harnessing the potential of quantum sensors to assist in navigation requires
enabling their operation in complex, dynamic environments and integrating them
within existing navigation systems. While cross-couplings from platform
dynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation
filters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data.
In this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an
atom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration
with a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to
simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we
show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry
results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian
errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching
navigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as
maintaining sensor tilt below 3.3 degrees, to inform future sensor development
priorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that
could support future optimization of the overall navigation system. Beyond
navigation, our atom interferometer modelling framework could be relevant to
current research and innovation endeavours with quantum gravimeters,
gradiometers and inertial sensors.

Conclusion: 这些算法突破为量子硬件上实现复杂速度场的2D/3D QLBM应用提供了可行性路径

Abstract: The Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) is one of the most promising
approaches for realizing the potential of quantum computing in simulating
computational fluid dynamics. Many recent works mostly focus on classical
simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues
like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain
unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum
hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to
implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer.
Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density
distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented.
Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform
advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability
of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple
timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by
the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the
explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent
the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation,
significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit
depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators.
Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D
QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.

Abstract: We present an efficient classical algorithm based on the construction of a
unitary quantum circuit for simulating the Isotropic Wave Equation (IWE) in
one, two, or three dimensions. Using an analogy with the massless Dirac
equation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to
first order, resulting in a Schr\"odinger equation of motion. Exact
diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks
allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid
points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into
diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix
Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the
Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement
when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions
with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly
efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the
wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for
carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations
such as Maxwell's equations.
