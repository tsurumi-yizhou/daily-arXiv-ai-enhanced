Numerical\nsolutions are of course possible but they are not always useful for\napplications. In the past a subspace approximation was proposed which allows to\ncompute important quantities such as the characteristic function as well as\ncertain expectation values. This previous approach was applied to solve the\none-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation which contains only a pitch-angle\nscattering term. In the current paper we extend this approach in order to solve\nthe Fokker-Planck equation with a focusing term. We employ two- and\nthree-dimensional subspace approximations to achieve a pure analytical\ndescription of particle transport. Additionally, we show that with higher\ndimensions, the subspace method can be used as a hybrid analytical-numerical\nmethod which produces an accurate approximation. Although the latter approach\ndoes not lead to analytical results, it is much faster compared to pure\nnumerical solutions of the considered transport equation."}

We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to\nimplement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer.\nHardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density\ndistribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented.\nFurthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform\nadvection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability\nof success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple\ntimesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by\nthe advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the\nexplicit QLBM algorithm.

However, these metrics do not directly evaluate\nthe physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly\ncritical concern in scientific and engineering applications.\n  Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine\nlearning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system.\nAddressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine\nlearning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in\napplications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.\n  In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting\nerror metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the\nunderlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed\ndynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse\npersistence ($\\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors --\ne.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity)\nand higher $\\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical\nconsistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that\nmeasure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\\theta$ versus their correct\nvalues. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and\nrecursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz,\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world\nweather forecasting task.

A shock-aware particle\nshifting procedure is introduced to regularize the particle distribution while\npreserving the integrity of shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first\ndemonstration of shock-based solution adaptivity and shock-aware particle\nshifting in the literature. A wide variety of test problems, which involve flow\nin and around boundaries, are employed to highlight the utility of these\nadaptivity features in improving the results and in making simulations faster.\nFor instance, the adaptive resolution procedure is shown to deliver an order of\nmagnitude speedup. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptivity\nprocedure in resolving existing issues like errors due to interaction with\ndifferently spaced ghost particles at boundaries, formation of spot-like\nstructures due to particle clumping, and poorly resolved low-density regions.\nIn essence, the adaptivity technique presented in this paper is positioned as a\npowerful tool for simulating compressible flows with enhanced accuracy and\nefficiency."}

Recently, there has been a spike\nin exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional\nneural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While showing\npromise, their performance advantages in physics-based problems remain largely\nunexplored. Several critical questions persist: Can KANs capture complex\nphysical dynamics and under what conditions might they outperform traditional\narchitectures? In this work, we present a comparative study of KANs and MLPs\nfor learning physical systems governed by PDEs. We assess their performance\nwhen applied in deep operator networks (DeepONet) and graph network-based\nsimulators (GNS), and test them on physical problems that vary significantly in\nscale and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the Kolmogorov Representation\nTheorem, we examine the behavior of KANs and MLPs across shallow and deep\nnetwork architectures. Our results reveal that although KANs do not\nconsistently outperform MLPs when configured as deep neural networks, they\ndemonstrate superior expressiveness in shallow network settings, significantly\noutpacing MLPs in accuracy over our test cases. This suggests that KANs are a\npromising choice, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy in applications\ninvolving physical systems."}
