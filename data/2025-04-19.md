### [1] [Hardware Implementation of Tunable Fractional-Order Capacitors by Morphogenesis of Conducting Polymer Dendrites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12861)
*Antoine Baron,Enrique H. Balaguera,Corentin Scholaert,Fabien Alibart,Sébastien Pecqueur*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TLDR: 提出利用导电聚合物枝晶（CPDs）的拓扑可塑性实现电子器件的动态突触可塑性，突破传统电子固定结构的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电子器件制造追求结构永恒不变，而生物系统通过拓扑可塑性实现低资源消耗的实时重构。受此启发，研究如何将非理想电化学特性转化为硬件可塑性。

Method: 利用电压脉冲生长CPDs对电极，通过结构变化调控其含常相位元件的电化学电容弛豫时间常数，实现毫秒至秒级的短期可塑性。

Result: 双CPD结构在电压脉冲刺激下展现出电流弛豫窗口扩展，证明结构编程可有效调控系统时间响应特性。

Conclusion: 物理瞬态的非理想电化学元件为模仿生物体动态适应能力提供了新路径，可能突破硅单晶材料的固有局限。

Abstract: Conventional electronics is founded on a paradigm where shaping perfect
electrical elements is done at the fabrication plant, so as to make devices and
systems identical, "eternally immutable". In nature, morphogenic evolutions are
observed in most living organisms and exploit topological plasticity as a
low-resource mechanism for in operando manufacturing and computation. Often
fractal, the resulting topologies feature inherent disorder: a property which
is never exploited in conventional electronics manufacturing, while necessary
for data generation and security in software. In this study, we present how
such properties can be exploited to implement long-term and evolvable synaptic
plasticity in an electronic hardware. The rich topology of conducting polymer
dendrites (CPDs) is exploited to program the non-ideality of their
electrochemical capacitances containing constant-phase-elements. Their
evolution through structural changes alters the characteristic time constants
for them to charge and discharge with the applied voltage stimuli. Under a
train of voltage spikes, the evolvable current relaxation of the
electrochemical systems promotes short-term plasticity with timescales ranging
from milliseconds to seconds. This large window depends on the temporality of
the voltage pulses used for reading, but also on the structure of a pair of
CPDs on two electrodes, grown by voltage pulses. This study demonstrates how
relevant physically transient and non-ideal electrochemical components can be
exploited for unconventional electronics, with the aim to mimic a universal
property of living organisms which could barely be replicated in a silicon
monocrystal.

### [2] [Extending the Mott-Gurney law to one-dimensional nonplanar diodes using point transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13138)
*Allen L. Garner,N. R. Sree Harsha,Amanda M. Loveless*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TLDR: 通过双射点变换将Mott-Gurney定律推广到非平面几何结构，提出用规范间隙距离替代笛卡尔距离的修正模型，并给出常见几何结构的计算结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要聚焦于真空环境下Child-Langmuir定律的几何扩展，缺乏对半导体/碰撞环境中Mott-Gurney定律在非平面结构中的系统性研究。

Method: 应用双射点变换和几何尺度因子，将经典Mott-Gurney定律中的笛卡尔间隙距离替换为与几何形状无关的规范间隙距离。

Result: 推导出适用于任意一维几何结构的修正Mott-Gurney定律，并具体计算了常见几何结构（如柱面、球面等）的规范间隙距离表达式。

Conclusion: 该几何推广方法具有普适性，不仅适用于空间电荷限制电流，还可拓展到非空间电荷限制情形及介于CLL与MGL之间的电流密度模型。

Abstract: Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and
point transformations to generalize the one-dimensional (1D) space-charge
limited current density (SCLCD) and electron emission mechanisms to nonplanar
geometries; however, these assessments have focused on extending the
Child-Langmuir law (CLL) for SCLCD in vacuum. Since the charge in the diode is
independent of coordinate system (i.e., covariant), we apply bijective point
transformations to extend the Mott-Gurney law (MGL) for the SCLCD in a
collisional or semiconductor gap to nonplanar 1D geometries. This yields a
modified MGL that replaces the Cartesian gap distance with a canonical gap
distance that may be written generally in terms of geometric scale factors that
are known for multiple geometries. We tabulate results for common geometries.
Such an approach may be applied to any current density, including
non-space-charge limited gaps and SCLCD that may fall between the CLL and MGL.

TLDR: 基于量子逻辑光谱技术研制的单铝离子光钟，通过远程激光稳定传输和新型离子阱设计，实现了5.5×10⁻¹⁹的频偏不确定度与3.5×10⁻¹⁶/√τ的稳定度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升原子钟精度与稳定性，消除微运动/碰撞位移等系统误差，验证远程激光稳频技术应用价值

Method: 采用协同囚禁的Mg⁺离子实现Al⁺量子态冷却与读出，利用3.6公里光纤传输的远程硅腔激光稳定技术延长Rabi探测至1秒，改进离子阱电学设计降低微运动，新真空系统减少碰撞频移

Abstract: We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency
uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5
\times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of
a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic
cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$
$^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s,
enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity
across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability
compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower
due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess
micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also
perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the
RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.

### [4] [PySEMTools: A library for post-processing hexahedral spectral element data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12301)

Conclusion: 该工具显著简化CFD复杂数据后处理流程，降低先进方法使用门槛，为流体力学研究提供高效基础设施支持。

Abstract: PySEMTools is a Python-based library for post-processing simulation data
produced with high-order hexahedral elements in the context of the spectral
element method in computational fluid dynamics. It aims to minimize
intermediate steps typically needed when analyzing large files. Specifically,
the need to use separate codebases (like the solvers themselves) at
post-processing. For this effect, we leverage the use of message passing
interface (MPI) for distributed computing to perform typical data processing
tasks such as spectrally accurate differentiation, integration, interpolation,
and reduced order modeling, among others, on a spectral element mesh. All the
functionalities are provided in self-contained Python code and do not depend on
the use of a particular solver. We believe that `PySEMTools` provides tools to
researchers to accelerate scientific discovery and reduce the entry
requirements for the use of advanced methods in computational fluid dynamics.

### [5] [Laser flash analysis using the Cattaneo heat equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12590)

Conclusion: Cattaneo热方程模型有效修正了传统方法的理论缺陷，为材料热物性测量提供了更精确的理论框架，配套代码公开增强了结果的可重复性

Abstract: Thermal diffusivity of solid materials is commonly measured using laser flash
analysis. This technique involves applying a heat pulse to the front surface of
a small sample of the material and calculating the thermal diffusivity from the
resulting increase in temperature on the back surface. Current formulas for the
thermal diffusivity are based on the assumption that heat is transported within
the sample according to the standard heat equation. While this assumption is
valid in most practical cases, it admits the non-physical property of infinite
propagation speed, that is, the heat pulse applied at the front surface is
instantaneously perceived at the back surface. This paper carries out a
mathematical analysis to determine the effect of replacing the standard heat
equation in laser flash analysis by the Cattaneo heat equation, which exhibits
finite propagation speed through the inclusion of a relaxation time in the
Fourier law. The main results of the paper include (i) analytical insights into
the spatiotemporal behaviour of temperature within the sample and (ii)
analytical formulas for determining the thermal diffusivity and relaxation time
of the sample. Numerical experiments exploring and verifying the analytical
results are presented with supporting MATLAB code made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该混合框架在铁电/热管理/超润滑等领域展现出显著应用潜力，优于现有纯机器学习或经验势方法

Abstract: Accurately modeling the structural reconstruction and thermodynamic behavior
of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures remains a significant challenge due to
the limitations of conventional force fields in capturing their complex
mechanical, thermal, electronic, and tribological properties. To address these
limitations, we develop a hybrid framework that combines single-layer
machine-learned potential ($s$MLP) with physics-based anisotropic interlayer
potential (ILP), effectively decoupling intralayer and interlayer interactions.
This $s$MLP+ILP approach modularizes the modeling of vdW heterostructures like
assembling LEGOs, reducing the required training configurations by at least an
order of magnitude compared to the pure MLP approach, while retaining
predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. We validate our framework by
accurately reproducing the mechanical properties of graphite, and resolving
intricate Moir\'e patterns in graphene/$h$-BN bilayers and
graphene/graphene/$h$-BN trilayer heterostructures, achieving excellent
agreement with experimental observations. Leveraging the developed $s$MLP+ILP
approach, we reveal the stacking order-dependent formation of Moir\'e
superlattice in trilayer graphene/$h$-BN/MoS$_2$ heterostructures,
demonstrating its ability to accurately model large-scale vdW systems
comprising hundreds of thousands of atoms with near $ab$ $initio$ precision.
These findings demonstrate that hybrid $s$MLP+ILP framework remarkably
outperforms existing pure machine-learned or empirical potentials, offering a
scalable and transferable solution for accurately and extensively modeling
complex vdW materials across diverse applications, including sliding
ferroelectricity, thermal management, resistive switching, and superlubric
nanodevices.

### [7] [Transforming Simulation to Data Without Pairing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12343)

Main category: physics.data-an

TLDR: 提出基于条件标准化流模型（CNF）的生成式机器学习方法，用于解决粒子物理中多维概率密度函数估计问题，在LHC Higgs双光子分析中验证有效性，并采用MDMM方法优化模型参数。

Conclusion: CNF模型与MDMM方法的结合为粒子物理数据分析提供了有效工具，通过机器学习实现了多维概率密度的精确建模，为后续物理量测量奠定基础。

Abstract: We explore a generative machine learning-based approach for estimating
multi-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) in a target sample using
a statistically independent but related control sample - a common challenge in
particle physics data analysis. The generative model must accurately reproduce
individual observable distributions while preserving the correlations between
them, based on the input multidimensional distribution from the control sample.
Here we present a conditional normalizing flow model (CNF) based on a chain of
bijectors which learns to transform unpaired simulation events to data events.
We assess the performance of the CNF model in the context of LHC Higgs to
diphoton analysis, where we use the CNF model to convert a Monte Carlo diphoton
sample to one that models data. We show that the CNF model can accurately model
complex data distributions and correlations. We also leverage the recently
popularized Modified Differential Multiplier Method (MDMM) to improve the
convergence of our model and assign physical meaning to usually arbitrary
loss-function parameters.

Result: 成功区分数据分布固有信息与时间关联信息，证明冗余噪声数据会降低信息提取效率

Conclusion: 该方法为各类系统的数据分析提供了通用、无需参数的量化标准，特别适用于复杂高维数据集分析

Abstract: Granting maximum information extraction in the analysis of noisy data is
non-trivial. We introduce a general, data-driven approach that employs Shannon
entropy as a transferable metric to quantify the maximum information
extractable from noisy data via their clustering into statistically-relevant
micro-domains. We demonstrate the method's efficiency by analyzing, as a
representative example, time-series data extracted from molecular dynamics
simulations of water and ice coexisting at the solid/liquid transition
temperature. The method allows quantifying the information contained in the
data distributions (time-independent component) and the additional information
gain attainable by analyzing data as time-series (i.e., accounting for the
information contained in data time-correlations). The approach is also highly
effective for high-dimensional datasets, providing clear demonstrations of how
considering components/data that may be little informative but noisy may be not
only useless but even detrimental to maximum information extraction. This
provides a general and robust parameter-free approach and quantitative metrics
for data-analysis, and for the study of any type of system from its data.

Abstract: Multigap cavities are used extensively in linear accelerators to achieve
velocities up to a few percent of the speed of light, driving nuclear physics
research around the world. Unlike for single-gap structures, there is no
closed-form expression to calculate the output beam parameters from the cavity
voltage and phase. To overcome this, we propose to use a method based on the
integration of the first and second moments of the beam distribution through
the axially symmetric time-dependent fields of the cavity. A beam-based
calibration between the model's electric field scaling and the machine's rf
amplitudes is presented, yielding a fast online energy change method, returning
cavity amplitude and phase necessary for a desired output beam energy and
energy spread. The method is validated with 23Na6+ beam energy measurements.

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of Beat-Note Superlattices (BNSLs), a
recently demonstrated technique for generating periodic trapping potentials for
ultracold atomic clouds, with arbitrarily large lattice spacings while
maintaining interferometric stability. By combining two optical lattices with
slightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed,
generating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity
equal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wavevectors of
the two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under
which this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against
perturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer
significant advantages in comparison to well established techniques for the
manipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of
BNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in
quantum technologies.

Abstract: Disordered potentials fundamentally alter the transport properties and
coherence of quantum systems. They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson
localization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When
interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly
more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed
remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is
expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state
without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a
ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite
temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced
phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold
bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the
Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved,
reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ
distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the
Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the
Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with
single-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of
the Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.

Motivation: Address unreliable predictions of GNNs on out-of-domain data by developing efficient uncertainty quantification techniques.

Method: Integrated DPOSE (Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles) into SchNet model, evaluated on QM9/OC20/GoldMD datasets.

Result: DPOSE successfully distinguishes in/out-domain samples with higher uncertainty for unseen materials classes.

Conclusion: Demonstrates lightweight UQ's potential for robust materials modeling and future active learning integration.

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by
providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material
properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art
approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However,
GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data
and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge,
we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct
Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient
alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we
assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse
Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular
Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes
between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for
unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of
lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials
modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning
strategies.

Conclusion: MFSM方法突破传统射线追踪限制，为复杂介质地震波衰减建模提供高效解决方案，具有重要工程应用价值。

Abstract: $t^*$ represents the total path attenuation and characterizes the amplitude
decay of a propagating seismic wave. Calculating the attenuation operator $t^*$
is typically required in seismic attenuation tomography. Traditional methods
for calculating $t^*$ require determining the ray path explicitly. However, ray
tracing can be computationally intensive when processing large datasets, and
conventional ray tracing techniques may fail even in mildly heterogeneous
media. In this study, we propose a modified fast sweeping method (MFSM) to
solve the governing equation for $t^*$ without explicitly calculating the ray
path. The approach consists of two main steps. First, the traveltime field is
calculated by numerically solving the eikonal equation using the fast sweeping
method. Second, $t^*$ is computed by solving its governing equation with the
MFSM, based on the discretization of the gradient of $t^*$ using an upwinding
scheme derived from the traveltime gradient. The MFSM is rigorously validated
through comparisons with analytical solutions and by examining $t^*$ errors
under grid refinement in both simple and complex models. Key performance
metrics, including convergence, number of iterations, and computation time, are
evaluated. Two versions of the MFSM are developed for both Cartesian and
spherical coordinate systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the
developed MFSM in calculating $t^*$ in North Island, and discuss the method's
efficiency in estimating earthquake response spectra.

Abstract: The single-band high-efficiency light absorption of nanostructures finds
extensive applications in var ious fields such as photothermal conversion,
optical sensing, and biomedicine. In this paper, a vertically stacked
nanohybrid structure is designed with aluminum arsenide (AlAs), indium tin ox
ide (ITO) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) stacked, and the photon absorption
characteristics of this structure under near-infrared light at a single
wavelength of 1240 nm are exploredbased on the finite difference time domain
(FDTD) method. When AlAs, ITO, and GaAs are stacked and incident light enters
from the GaAs side, a local light enhancement phenomenon occurs. The absorption
rate can reach 91.67%, and the temperature change rate reaches 55. 53%,
allowing for a wide-range regulation the absorption rate by temperature. In
addition, the AlAs/ITO/GaAs sandwich-type hybrid structure also exhibits
obvious nonreciprocity. With the change in temperature, the absorption rate of
different structural sizes varies differently. The structure can be optimized
and designed according to the requirements, providing new ideas for the design
of multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) are widely used photonic components for
splitting and combining different wavelengths of light. They play a key role in
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems by enabling efficient routing of
multiple data channels over a single optical fiber and as a building block for
various optical signal processing, computing, imaging, and spectroscopic
applications. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating AWGs in
ferroelectric material platforms, as the platform simultaneously provide
efficient electro-optic modulation capability and thus hold the promise for
fully integrated WDM transmitters. To date, several demonstrations have been
made in the X-cut thin-film lithium niobate ($\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$) platform, yet,
the large anisotropy of $\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ complicates the design and degrades
the performance of the AWGs. To address this limitation, we use the recently
developed photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on thin-film lithium
tantalate ($\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$), a material with a similar Pockels coefficient
as $\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ but significantly reduced optical anisotropy, as an
alternative viable platform. In this work, we manufacture $\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$
AWGs using deep ultraviolet lithography on a wafer-scale. The fabricated AWGs
feature a channel spacing of 100 GHz, an insertion loss of < 4 dB and crosstalk
of < -14 dB. In addition, we demonstrate a cyclic AWG, as well as a
multiplexing and demultiplexing AWG pair for the first time on
$\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ platform. The wafer-scale fabrication of these AWGs not only
ensures uniformity and reproducibility, but also paves the way for realizing
volume-manufactured integrated WDM transmitters in ferroelectric photonic
integrated platforms.

Result: 数值模拟验证了模型有效性，证明其能预测不同激光参数下的损伤形貌特征。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解非热烧蚀机制提供了新视角，并为优化超快激光加工工艺建立了理论工具。

Abstract: Much experimental evidence reveals that Coulomb explosion governs non-thermal
material removal under femtosecond or even shorter laser pulses, and
non-thermal laser damage has been a topic widely discussed. Nevertheless, there
is still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of
such damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage
through a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter
of the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion,
electron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates
material from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in
localized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability
and demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser
conditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and
provides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing.

Abstract: Parametric arrays (PA) offer exceptional directivity and compactness compared
to conventional loudspeakers, facilitating various acoustic applications.
However, accurate measurement of audio signals generated by PA remains
challenging due to spurious ultrasonic sounds arising from microphone
nonlinearities. Existing filtering methods, including Helmholtz resonators,
phononic crystals, polymer films, and grazing incidence techniques, exhibit
practical constraints such as size limitations, fabrication complexity, or
insufficient attenuation. To address these issues, we propose and demonstrate a
novel acoustic filter based on the design of a half-wavelength resonator. The
developed filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution,
effectively minimizing microphone exposure to targeted ultrasonic frequencies.
Fabrication via stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing ensures high dimensional
accuracy, which is crucial for high-frequency acoustic filters. Finite element
method (FEM) simulations guided filter optimization for suppression frequencies
at 40 kHz and 60 kHz, achieving high transmission loss (TL) around 60 dB.
Experimental validations confirm the filter's superior performance in
significantly reducing spurious acoustic signals, as reflected in frequency
response, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements. The proposed filter
ensures stable and precise acoustic characterization, independent of
measurement distances and incidence angles. This new approach not only improves
measurement accuracy but also enhances reliability and reproducibility in
parametric array research and development.

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement and reset of subsets of qubits is a crucial
ingredient of quantum error correction and many quantum information
applications. Measurement of atomic qubits is accomplished through resonant
fluorescence, which typically disturbs neighboring atoms due to photon
scattering. We propose and prototype a new scheme for measurement that provides
both spatial and spectral isolation by using tightly-focused individual laser
beams and narrow atomic transitions. The unique advantage of this scheme is
that all operations are applied exclusively to the read-out qubit, with
negligible disturbance to the other qubits of the same species and little
overhead. In this letter, we pave the way for non-invasive and high fidelity
mid-circuit measurement and demonstrate all key building blocks on a single
trapped barium ion.

Abstract: We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a
trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in
$^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating
data qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the
metastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable
state without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both
methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$
ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit.
These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without
degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser
noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated
method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without
shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the
architecture.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations are crucial in industrial
applications but require extensive computational resources, particularly for
extreme turbulent regimes. While classical digital approaches remain the
standard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more
efficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits.
  This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid
quantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).
The inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion
and solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate
this method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions,
periodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on
high-performance computing resources.
  Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error
fidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for
practical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small
lattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway
to mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation.
