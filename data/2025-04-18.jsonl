They play a key role in\nwavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems by enabling efficient routing of\nmultiple data channels over a single optical fiber and as a building block for\nvarious optical signal processing, computing, imaging, and spectroscopic\napplications. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating AWGs in\nferroelectric material platforms, as the platform simultaneously provide\nefficient electro-optic modulation capability and thus hold the promise for\nfully integrated WDM transmitters. To date, several demonstrations have been\nmade in the X-cut thin-film lithium niobate ($\\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$) platform, yet,\nthe large anisotropy of $\\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ complicates the design and degrades\nthe performance of the AWGs. To address this limitation, we use the recently\ndeveloped photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on thin-film lithium\ntantalate ($\\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$), a material with a similar Pockels coefficient\nas $\\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ but significantly reduced optical anisotropy, as an\nalternative viable platform. In this work, we manufacture $\\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$\nAWGs using deep ultraviolet lithography on a wafer-scale. The fabricated AWGs\nfeature a channel spacing of 100 GHz, an insertion loss of < 4 dB and crosstalk\nof < -14 dB. In addition, we demonstrate a cyclic AWG, as well as a\nmultiplexing and demultiplexing AWG pair for the first time on\n$\\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ platform. The wafer-scale fabrication of these AWGs not only\nensures uniformity and reproducibility, but also paves the way for realizing\nvolume-manufactured integrated WDM transmitters in ferroelectric photonic\nintegrated platforms."}

Nevertheless, there\nis still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of\nsuch damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage\nthrough a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter\nof the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion,\nelectron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates\nmaterial from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in\nlocalized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability\nand demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser\nconditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and\nprovides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing."}

While classical digital approaches remain the\nstandard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more\nefficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits.\n  This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid\nquantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).\nThe inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion\nand solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate\nthis method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions,\nperiodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on\nhigh-performance computing resources.\n  Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error\nfidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for\npractical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small\nlattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway\nto mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation."}
