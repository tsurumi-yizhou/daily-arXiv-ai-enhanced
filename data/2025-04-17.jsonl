We propose a Lyapunov-based\nadaptive controller that can estimate and compensate for reaction wheels\ndegradation simultaneously. The controller incorporates an adaptive update\ncontrol law with a gradient-based term and an integral concurrent learning term\nthat collects input-output data for online estimation of uncertain parameters.\nThe proposed controller guarantees attitude tracking and its performance is\ntested through numerical simulations."}

Here, we introduce a novel protocol that\nachieves this goal by measuring phase correlations of AC magnetic fields using\nensembles of NV centers. Our method extends the sensing dynamic range to\nfrequencies higher than the system's Rabi frequency while achieving arbitrary\nfrequency resolution, limited only by the target field coherence time.\nMoreover, our approach operates more robustly with respect to the magnetic\nfield's amplitude. Thanks to this robustness, our protocol allows the\napplication of more $\\pi$-pulses in pulse sequences such as CPMG, enabling the\ndecoupling of a broader range of frequency noise. The higher harmonics\ngenerated in this process continue to act as a part of the signal, ultimately\nimproving the frequency resolution. This method paves the way for achieving\narbitrary frequency resolution with improved performances, making it highly\nversatile for quantum sensing applications across diverse scientific fields."}

When filled with magnetic particles, their\neffective mechanical response can be modified by an external magnetic field. In\nthe present study, we propose an effective theory of fibre-reinforced\ncomposite, based on a neo-Hookean elastic response and a linear magnetic law in\neach phase. The theory is shown suitable to describe the motion of composite\ncylinders. Furthermore, it is found appropriate for the modelling of\nfibre-reinforced composites subjected to a permanent magnetic field aligned\nwith the fibres. To reach this result, we use the incremental theory ('small on\nlarge'), in combination with homogenisation theory and the Bloch-Floquet\nmethod. This way, we show that wave directivity is sensitive to the application\nof a permanent magnetic field, whereas the frequency range in which wave\npropagation is forbidden is not modified by such a load (the band gaps are\ninvariant). In passing, we describe a method to deduce the total stress in the\nmaterial based on the measurement of two wave speeds. Furthermore, we propose\nan effective energy function for the description of nonlinear composites made\nof Yeoh-type generalised neo-Hookean fibres within a neo-Hookean matrix."}
